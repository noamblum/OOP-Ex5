Infinity World Creation:
Tree and Terrain classes are capable to create and manage themselves:
when given a specific range,adding randomly to GameObjectCollection in that range, and removing all other instances
that outside the range.
PepsiGameManager responsible to give Those classes the range. the range will be related to the position of the Avatar.
By the way Random works, we can "random" back the trees and the terrain to be exactly where they were before in each
segment of the world.

Tree class:
For creating trees in the game we decided to split the creation of the leaves and the creation of the tree trunk.
it helped us to manage the attributes of the leaves- swing in the wind, fall down and fade out, fade in and return to the
initial position.
The tree class is getting a range to put put tree instances in it, it creates treeTrunks - Blocks in brown color, and place
them randomly and creates leaves tha are instances of Leaf, around the trunk.
We keep the instances of the components of each tree in a set, and each set as a value in a hash map that the key is
the x coordinate of the tree in the map.
It is helping us to delete those objects when needed - When the x coordinate of a tree is out of the range game manager
updated.

The differences between UML_start and UML_end:
The differences between the files embodies the dilemmas we face with during our work.
(1) grid coordination:
    We decided to create a class that converts between continuous world coordinates and discrete block grid coordinates.
    Terrain and tree use block class for determine the dimensions of the their instances, and because those
    objects are constantly changing, it is easier to work with grid values.
Perllin class
(3) Leaf inherits from game object and tree class is not containing leaf class:
    Helped us to mange the attributes of each part of the tree separately - The trunk is static, while
    the leaves have timeLife and some of them falling from the tree and returning to initial position
    after a set up time.
Terrain contains ProceduralPerlinMap and is not using it.
